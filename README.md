- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Limunini!
I am a graduate mechanical engineer with a passion for software development and problem solving! Good thing these two seem to go hand in hand..

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
Software Development. I've doing it as a hobby for the last 2 and a half years. I enjoy the challenge of learning languages, creating new code, improving old code I wrote (who doesn't like looking back on code you wrote a month ago and seeing your progress?) and problem solving code that is just being stubborn!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I did some Python programming during my time at university, but have since been doing more advanced courses in Python. I am also doing online courses in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Mendix and because I get asked about it a lot, Excel.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
Just send me an email!
